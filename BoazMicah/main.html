          Ever since the successful isolation of a single sheet of graphene from
          bulk graphite in 2004, research into two-dimensional materials, where
          the layers are held by weak forces, has attracted a lot of research
          interest. This is mainly driven by the compelling properties of the
          individual atomic layers. With these materials, novel devices such as
          tunnelling transistors, resonant tunnelling diodes and light emitting
          diodes have been discovered. 2D materials have properties that are
          strikingly different from ther 3D parent compound, and their
          properties ranges from metals, semi-metals, semiconductors to
          insulators. Beacuse these layered materials are held by weak foces,
          the individual atomic layers can easily be separated and transferred
          onto a wide variety of subtrates, enabling easy integration with
          silicon technology that is technologically mature. However, 2D magnets
          have remained elusive, and was recently discovered in 2017. This was
          and still remains very exciting as it they offer the possibility of
          tuning their electronic and mechanical properties using an electric
          field or stain. This permits the conception of devices where the
          magnetism is controlled at will. The combination of 2D magnets and
          other 2D materials will probably result in structures with completely
          new and unexpected properties we can explore both theoretically and
          experimentally. The challenge now is to find 2D magnets at room
          temperature.

            This article is about a project that investigated the structural
            properties of the layered semiconducting material, vanadium iodide.
            VI3 is confirmed to become magnetic around 50 K down to its
            monolayers in the literature. Also, it is accepted within the
            literature that the crystal structure of the compound changes around
            80 K. This structural transition was also confirmed in this project.
            However, there are controversies surrounding the crystal struture of
            the material above and below the transition. Different studies
            report different structures in the high and low temperature regime.
            The VI3 material is of special importance because it offers more
            opportunities to study magnetism in layered structures and offers
            more possiblities for future 2D devices. The inconclusiveness of
            determinng the crystal structure of VI3 has limited our full
            understanfing of its properties and its potential as a monolayer
            magnetic material. To solve this, the project used all the reported
            and many unreported crystal structures to describe the compound. The
            aim was to find the best crystal structure that describes VI3 at all
            temperatures.

            The high-temperature structure of VI3 is trigonal, with the best
            fitting space group being R-3. The compound transitions into the
            lower symmetry monoclinic structure below 80 K. The best fitting
            space group in the low temperature region is the C2/c space group.

          The process of determining the crystal structure of the powdered VI3
          starts by shining X-rays onto the material. The radiation scatters and
          carries information about the material. The scattered radiation is
          observed as a diffraction and it is unique to the material being
          irradiated. VI3 is a crystal, meaning it is made up of unit blocks
          that spread out through the whole crystal. Hence, describing this unit
          block is all that is needed to describe the whole crystal. The unit
          cell is described by its lenght in the X,Y and Z directions, and also
          the position of its atoms. A space group, which is a set of symmetry
          operations, is used to obtain the corrdinates of all the atoms in the
          crystal using the unit cell information. There are 230 possible space
          groups. The structural information about the unit cell and the space
          group are obtained from the diffraction pattern. This is done by
          creating a model that tries to match the diffraction pattern by
          refining the structural parameters. The specific space group when
          combined with the refined structural paramters that closely match the
          diffraction pattern is the crystal structure of the material. This
          process is called Rietveld refinement, and more details can be found
          here.
          <span>
            The project used the Rietveld method to see how closely each of the
            reported crystal structures match the measured diffraction pattern.
            It was found that the R-3 rhombohedral space group best describes
            the crystal structure at high temperatures. The C2/c monoclinic
            space group best fits the X-ray diffraction pattern at low
            temperatures. This project helped clarify the confusion surrounding
            the crystal structure of vanadium iodide. With the crystal structure
            settled, future research projects can focus on the magnetic
            properties of the crystal. This may help pave the way to enable 2D
            magnets to be used as the architecture of the next-generation
            electronic devices.

          I think different projects create different quality of the sample. VI2
          can be grown with the VI3 sample, and this leads to different crystal
          structures. The reason for this is a mystery.
